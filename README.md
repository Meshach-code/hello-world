# hello-world
Hi everyone, my name is Meshach and I am new here, I am a graduate of Statistics but I am looking to go further with Data Science skills, please be nice and help me achieve this, I would be very grateful for any form of assistance.

To be honest, I really dont know anything about coding, all I have in my arsenal is a basic understanding of Statistical processes, I am really scared about this data science especially because of all the coding involved, but I trust with God I can pull this off.
